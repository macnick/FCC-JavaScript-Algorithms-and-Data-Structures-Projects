# FCC JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

My solutions to FCC's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

[freeCodeCamp.org](http://freecodecamp.org) is a non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, Medium publications and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone.

This respository contains my personal solutions to the Javascript challenges and exercises that appear on their site. The solutions have evolved along with my knowledge of the language and data structures and algorithms in general. Doing these and other exercises at Codewars.com helped me a lot. 

I decided to publicly share the solutions with the intention of helping other students who might get stuck or who might want to see how someone else approached the same exercise and learn from their approach.

Just like freeCodeCamp, this repository is meant to be a learning resource assisting you in your quest to become a proficient web developer. It is not meant to let you copy and paste the solutions, so that you can get through the curriculum as quickly as possible.

Do the challenges on your own, write your own code that passes the tests, and consult this repository only if you truly have no idea how to pass an exercise or to check if there is perhaps a better, simpler or more efficient way of solving it.

Copying the solutions into the freeCodeCamp editor might let you cheat your way through the system, but it will not help you become a better developer. The only person you will be cheating is yourself.
